### Question: How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?

### Answer: Rental prices continue to rise with some small dips in particular years, some neighborhoods are seeing a decrease in sales per sft and some are increasing or at least stable. 

### Question: What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?

### Answer: I would share the insight of rent prices increasing in many neighborhoods as well as availablilty slightly rising year over year. There are some neighborhoods I would suggust for investment based on the rent prices increasing and the price per sft making a slight upward movement. That would show that the neighborhood is trending upward but still staying towards the lower end of the price per SFT, which should make for an all around good investment.
